# Password Generator

- The Password Generator is a Python application that generates a secure, random password based on user input. The program allows users to specify the number of letters, numbers, and symbols they want in their password. It then randomly selects characters from predefined lists and shuffles them to create a strong, unpredictable password.

### Features:

- Customizable Password Length: Allows users to specify the number of letters, numbers, and symbols they want in the password.
- Randomized Output: Randomly selects characters from predefined lists for strong password generation.
- Password Shuffling: After selecting characters, the password is shuffled to ensure the order is unpredictable.
- Easy-to-Use Interface: Prompts the user for input and provides the generated password immediately.
